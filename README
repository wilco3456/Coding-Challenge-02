The file sales.json contains a list of dictionaries, each dictionary contains
these keys:
- date
- amount (pennies)
- agent

Your task is to write script that prints out a table showing the total value of
each agent's sales per month using only the python standard library like this:

Agent   Jan Sales  Jan Total    Feb Sales  Feb Total    Mar Sales  Mar Total
Andy         30     4,100.00         25     5,199.25         32       250.32
Belinda      50    10,125.33         15       100.00         27     1.250.67

This should take a maximum of 45 minutes to an hour.
